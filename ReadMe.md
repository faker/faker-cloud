# Faker Cloud

Faker Cloud is a cloud based solution for [faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js). Faker Cloud provides a web based User Interface and REST API for managing data schemas which can be accessed in real-time to generate and download dynamic and random data from faker.js

# Why use Faker Cloud and not Faker.js?

You *should* use [faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js)! We use it everyday. It's a great library!

What Faker Cloud allows developers to do is avoid having to program any code or setup any local development environments for creating fake test data. You can quickly generate a spreadsheet of data to download, or host a simple API endpoint on a hosted Faker Cloud URL.
